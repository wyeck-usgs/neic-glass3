 * \brief glasscore correlation class
 *
 * The CCorrelation class is the class that encapsulates everything necessary
 * to represent a waveform arrival correlation, including arrival time, phase id,
 * and an unique identifier.  The CCorrelation class is also a node in the
 * detection graph database.
 *
 * CCorrelation contains functions to support creation of a new event based
 * on the correlation.
 *
 * CCorrelation maintains a graph database link between it and the the site
 * (station) the correlation was made at.
 *
 * CCorrelation also maintains a weak_ptr to a CHypo object representing a graph
 * database link between this correlation and a hypocenters.  A single
 * correlation may be included in multiple hypocenters, but a correlation will
 * only include a single hypocenter
 *
 * CCorrelation uses smart pointers (std::shared_ptr).
